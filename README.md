# Naive_Bayes_Python_Classifier
A python implementation of multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. In this sample, the classifier identifies the fortune cookie lines as a wise saying or a prediction. 

Outputs the percentage of correctly tested objects to the "results.txt" file in /data. 

Test data will be lower than the trained data, but this is to be expected. Trained data should produce a >95% success rate to be considered effective.
